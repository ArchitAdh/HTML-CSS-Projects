# Archit’s CSS Projects

This repository is a collection of front-end projects I built back in **2020** while learning and experimenting with **HTML, CSS, and SCSS**.  
No frameworks, no libraries, no JavaScript-heavy stuff — just pure styling, layouts, responsiveness, and animations.

These projects helped me understand how real websites are structured, styled, and made responsive before moving on to more advanced tools.
